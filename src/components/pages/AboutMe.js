        Hi there, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Thiviya Sivasithamparam
        and I currently reside in the GTA. I am currently in my last week at the
        bootcamp at the University of Toronto's School of Continuining Studies
        Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Over the last 12 weeks, I have gained so
        much knowledge from the various projects I have worked on. Please feel
        free to take a look around at my portfolio and contact me if you have
        any questions!
