# Module 20 Challenge - React Portfolio

## The Task

The task was to create a portfolio, using our new React skills to help set us apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
